| âœ… **Higher-Order Functions**                         | Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.                              |
| âœ… **Callback Functions**                             | Used for async logic (e.g., `setTimeout`, `fetch`).                                           |
| âœ… **Closures**                                       | Functions that remember the scope they were created in.                                       |
| âœ… **Recursion**                                      | A function that calls itself.                                                                 |
| âœ… **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** | Executes immediately after it is defined.                                                     |
| âœ… **Currying**                                       | Transforming a function with multiple arguments into a series of functions with one argument. |
